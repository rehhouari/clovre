> Notice how the folders and images **can** have different naming conventions but what matters is they're all **orderd numerically**s

> I find [Hakuneko](https://github.com/manga-download/hakuneko) the best downloader and the folder structure is compatible with Clovre as well.
  
## Deployment

No build step, use a webserver with **HTTPS support**. like Caddy
<details>
<summary>example Caddyfile</summary>
<code><pre>localhost
root * /path/to/repo/clovre
file_server</pre></code>
</details>
  
## Why

I wanted a way to read manga comfortably on PC because it's been ages. After trying quite a few options, none met my special needs so I put this together over the weekend.

## Tech Stack

**App**: [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev), [Twind](https://twind.dev/).

It uses the new [Filesystem Access API](https://web.dev/file-system-access/) to access files with user permission. (drag & drop doesn't show a prompt if you're annoyed by that)

**API**: Generously provided for free by [AniList.co](https://anilist.co)
